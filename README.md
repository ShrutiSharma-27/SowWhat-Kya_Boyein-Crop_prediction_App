## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Crop Guidance and Farmers Friend - (BioTech)
The needs of contemporary agriculture, which demands high-yield, high-quality, and efficient production, cannot be met by conventional agricultural practices. Furthermore, farmers face the main challenge of how to adapt to changing customer preferences. It is critical to modernize existing processes and use data acquired over time to determine the best potential farming practices that should be implemented. Develop a solution that uses the potential of AI to address this problem.

## OVERVIEW :  
This is a project made for HackOverflow 2.0 within 48 hours. SowWhat app name indicates a question which is prevalent among farmers regarding what to sow on a particular land. So this app will act as an answer to this long time lingering question as mentioned before. In addtion to prediction this app will suggest some new sustainable agriculture practices to farmers.
Our team had chosen a problem statement related to **Crop Guidance and Farmers Friend - (BioTech)**. We had majorly utilized Machine Learning to make predictions and used Flutter and Firebase to integrate our ML model into a mobile app. This app aims to ease the decision making of farmers.

## INSPIRATION :
Farmers living in different areas have different climates, landscapes, microorganisms, plants and animals so they must adapt their growing practices to local conditions. Managing the decision-making processes of farming has always been complex because there are so many different limiting factors that aren’t within a farmer’s control. So if we can contribute a little to minimize their problem to any extent then also it's overwhelming for our team.

## WHAT OUR TEAM HAD BUILT ?
We had made a mobile app named SowWhat. This app takes input of **Nitrogen** content, **Phosphorous** content, **Potassium** content, **pH value** of soil and **Humidity**, **Rainfall**, and average **Temperature**. After getting input of all values from user, it predicts the best crop that can be grown in that particular area with maximum profit. It aware the farmers by providing some additional knowledge regarding some new sustainable methods that they can practise on their land to promote sustainability. 
###### RELEVANCE TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT :
As the problem statement suggests that we have to devise something using AI for farmers that will serve as a solution to one of their problems faced practising conventional  agricultural practises. Our prediction app will help the farmers in selection process of a crop for a particular agricultural land. This will leads to efficient agriculture and maximum utilisation of resources in right direction which in turn is a sustainable practise.
